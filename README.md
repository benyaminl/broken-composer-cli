# Sample of broken Symphony/Composer command

This is a sample project that try to run `composer <command>` with extends symphony/command, but failed misserably. I need help on the debugging on why as just following docs, it doesn't work as it's. So Sad... 

The command is 

```
composer contoh
```

the working command is 

```
composer try
```

will output 

```
Hello World
```
